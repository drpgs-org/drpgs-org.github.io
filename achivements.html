                            The area of Genomics is becoming very important in biological, biomedical, industrial and agricultural sciences by providing newer tools in gathering information on genome diversity of organisms. This new field is also expected to provide solutions in
                            biomedical research by creating possibilities to new therapies for genetic and microbial diseases including AIDS and tuberculosis. Because of its immediate and considerable impact, there is demand for highly qualified and trained
                            manpower in this field. This program is supported by UGC with grant of 5 Crores during 2002-2007 and another 5 Crores for the period from 2007-2012. In addition to the M.Sc. Genomics programme, he is coordinating more than
                            10 research projects under this scheme conducted by various Principal Investigators. This centre is involved in high quality teaching and research activities in the area of Genomic Sciences.

                            M.Sc. Genomics is offered since 2002 from the School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University. Students with high academic standards are selected through a national level entrance test conducted by the University. A maximum of 16 students are
                            admitted to M.Sc. Genomics each year and 40 % of the seats are reserved for other state students. The course is offered under Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) according to the UGC's recommendations. The course is framed to
                            render a balanced teaching in theoretical, practical and computational aspects. Molecular Biology, Molecular Genetics, Biochemistry, Cell Biology, Computational Biology and Immunology are the basic courses offered in the first
                            year. Bioinformatics, Microbial Genomics, Human Genomics, Proteomics, Plant Genomics, Structural Biology and Neurogenetics are the courses offered in the third semester. Final semester is designed for a dedicated project work
                            in Genomic Sciences.
